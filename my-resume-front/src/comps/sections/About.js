            <p>
                I am a Full Stack Web Developer, with a passion of making user-friendly and approachable apps,
                that just make life a little easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                In web development I tend to lean more towards the back-end, but I love building a colorful
                and inviting interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                In non-programing aspects I am a paramedic, pet mom, and hate being bored.
                Also, I can make ugly but very tasty cakes.
            </p>
